## ðŸ“– Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless communications, where problems require precise manipulation of information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent performance.

We present **WirelessMathLM**, demonstrating that compact models (0.5Bâ€“7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique propertyâ€”verifiable correctnessâ€”that enables effective reinforcement learning without human feedback.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Contributions

- **WirelessMathBench-XL**: A comprehensive benchmark of 4,027 problems from 970 papers in wireless communications
- **Domain-specific RL**: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with binary verification rewards, training directly from base checkpoints without supervised warm-start
- **Efficient Performance**: Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using ~100Ã— fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%)
- **Transfer Learning**: Positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks (+8.4 points average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and AIME)

## ðŸ“Š Results Overview

### Model Performance on WirelessMathBench-XL

| Model | Parameters | Accuracy |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **WirelessMathLM-7B** | 7B | **39.5%** |
| GPT-4o | ~1.8T | 40.4% |
| DeepSeek-R1 | 671B | 57.4% |

### GRPO Training Impact

GRPO training nearly doubles performance across all model scales:
- **0.5B**: +11% improvement
- **3B**: +103% improvement
- **7B**: +81% improvement


## ðŸ“‹ Dataset: WirelessMathBench-XL

WirelessMathBench-XL contains **4,027 mathematical problems** extracted from **970 research papers** in wireless communications, covering:

- Information theory and channel capacity
- Signal processing and beamforming
- Optimization in wireless networks
- MIMO systems and spatial diversity
- Resource allocation and scheduling

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology

### Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)

Our approach uses GRPO with binary verification rewards:

1. **No Supervised Fine-tuning**: Train directly from base model checkpoints
2. **Verifiable Rewards**: Leverage the mathematical nature of wireless problems for automatic verification
3. **Domain-specific Training**: Focus specifically on wireless communications mathematics
4. **Efficient Scaling**: Achieve strong performance with compact models
